I am familiar with programming languages Java, Python, React, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. 
<br><br>

#### Previously
I previously worked as a Software Developer for Caseware International Inc from fall of 2019 to the summer of 2020. I was a member of an Agile team responsible for designing and building new features, fixing bugs, and creating automated unit tests for the company's auditing software. I primarily worked with the JavaScript language.<br><br>

I also previously worked as a Full Stack Developer for UTSC in the winter of 2019. I created a web platform using React for the "SDI Project", aimed towards helping local Scarborough agencies predict the necessary services that newcomers need to settle down.

At the moment, I am looking for a Summer 2021 coop placement.
